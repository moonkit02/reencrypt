WELCOME TO RE:NCRYPT

This is my final year project, which is a very light web extension (only for chrome based browser user).
Feel free to try it!

What it does
Are you having difficulty in remembering complicated password, and having hard time to create them for each website? Do you always wished for only memorizing one password for all website?

RE:ncyrpt will help you to turn your simple password into a strong password. For example, "ezpwd" is the password that u memorize. BUT obviously it is very weak, so by using RE:ncrypt, for every website you go, you just simply type in "ezpwd" then encrypt it using the RE:ncrypt. It will ensure you to have unique, strong password for every website.
